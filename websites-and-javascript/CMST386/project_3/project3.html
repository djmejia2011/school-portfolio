			<h2>Project 3</h2>
				<h3>Importance of Responsive Design and its Impact on the Target Audience:</h3>
					<p>Responsive design is important because if we were to design a fixed size website with a width of 700px we would be leaving out a big portion of our target audience that uses smaller screens.
						therefore, responsive design is used to adjust the content of a website and allow every user to experience the site to its fullest with whatever device they use.</p>
					<h3>Three Different Kinds of Reports found on Google Analytics:</h3>
						<p>One of the reports that will tell us more information about our target audience is the one about demographics because we want to be able to see the age group and gender that is accessing our site.
						 We also want to see how they interact with the content of the site such as their bounce rate, session duration and how many pages they visited per session.
						 The second that we are looking for is the technology report because we want to be able to see what our target audience is using to access our site.
						 What type of device, operating systems, and browsers. The third report is called Users flow and it allows us to see the flow of our target audience through our website.</p>
