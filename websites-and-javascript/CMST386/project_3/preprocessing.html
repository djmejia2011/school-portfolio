			<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
				<h3>Ways of Implementing Preprocessing(client-side vs server-side):</h3>
					<p>Preprocessing for LESS can be done at the server-side or at the client-side(in the browser).
						Preprocessing on the client-side is done by downloading a compiler named less.js and coping into the working directory of the site.
						Preprocessing at the server-side is done by downloading node package manager and then the lessc compiler.
						Once we have a LESS file all we have to do is run the command lessc and the compiler will create a CSS file automatically.</p>
					<h3>Mechanisms Used in LESS:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Mixins:</strong> are blocks of code that can be reused anywhere in the code and can contain arguments.</li>
						<li><strong>Variables:</strong> variables like in computer programing are used to store values that can be accessed anywhere in the code. For example,
							a variable @font-color: black; can be created and used wherever we need the font color to be black.  This is helpful because it simplifies future changes to the style sheet.</li>
						<li><strong>Functions:</strong> LESS contain a number of built-in mathematical, color,list, strings, and type functions that allows the user to easily manipulate values when needed.</li>
						<li><strong>Operators:</strong> Arithmetic operators are included in LESS. this allows the user to add, subtract, multiply and divide values.</li>
						<li><strong>Nested Variables:</strong> LESS allows the user to reflect the relationship between the different elements by allowing the use of nesting elements inside other elements.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Implementation of LESS Preprocessing:</h3>
						<p>I implemented LESS using a windows software called less-watch-compiler that automatically compiles my styles.less found in a source folder called less.
							the less-watch-compiler then keeps watching for any changes that i do in the less file and automatically updates my styles.css file whenever edits are done to the styles.less file.</p>
							<p>I took advantage of the variables, operator, nested variables and mixins mechanisms found in the LESS code in the following way:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Variables:</strong> I was able to create diferent variables specially for colors.  the use of variables allows me to change the color of the layout in very little time.</li>
									<li><strong>Nested Variables:</strong> Nested variables was something i used a lot.  Nesting elements felt simple and straight forward. Nested variables were used when styling navigation, unorder list, and hover</li>
									<li><strong>Mixins:</strong> I used one mixin in this project.  I created a mixin that would allow me to center block elements in the page.</li>
								</ul>
