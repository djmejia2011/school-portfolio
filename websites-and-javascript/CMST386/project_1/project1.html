		<h2>Project 1</h2>
		<h3>How search engines work.</h3>
		Search engines use specialized software called spiders to crawl millions of pages in order to read and index their content. Once a spider reads the content on the page, it begins to follow links to other pages.  This process allows the search engine to find new pages all around the internet.
		Whenever a person conducts a query, the search engine compares keywords to those found in its database of millions of pages and displays the most relevant back to the person doing the query.
		<h3>The Importance of Keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h3>
		Keywords are the most important part of the algorithm in search engines. Keywords are what is stored inside the search engines database. Descriptions as meta tags help the search engine understand the content of the website. In google, for example, the description meta tag is displayed underneath the title of the search results.
		<h3>The Four Elements that comprise writing relevant content links.</h3>
		The four elements that comprise writing relevant content links are the following:
		<ol>
		<li>The links should be descriptive and provide a simple idea of where the link is taking the user.</li>
		<li>The links should be a short phrase but descriptive.</li>
		<li>The links should be easy to distinguish from other text and background.</li>
		<li>Having internal links in the page is recommended, it allows google to navigate the page better.</li>
		</ol> 
     
		<h3>Heading Hierarchy</h3>
		Search engines look for heading hierarchy inside the website content and start to organize the website with the most important heading tag &lt;h1&gt; 
		it then continues to the rest of the heading tags &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and so on.  
		This heading hierarchy is why its important to organize the page content using the correct heading tag so that search engines detect the most important content on the page. For example



<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Main title of the page content&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  
  &lt;h2&gt;Secondary title of an article&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
   
   &lt;p&gt;article content&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;/body&gt;<br>
