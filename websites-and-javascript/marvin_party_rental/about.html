            <h2>Rental Policies</h2>
            <h5>MAKING A RESERVATION</h5>
            <p>To confirm a reservation we require your contact information, a valid credit card number on file, a non-refundable deposit, and a signature on your rental contract.
              The deposit is equal to 40% of your order total and is applied towards your final balance. Your order will not be considered ‘reserved’ until a deposit and signed contract are received.<p>
            <h5>PAYMENTS</h5>
            <p>Payments can be made in any of the following ways: credit card, Interac, cash. We take payments in person. You may pay the final balance on your account at any point before your event,
              but we must receive payment before the items can be delivered or picked-up.</p>
            <h5>CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS</h5>
            <p>Your satisfaction is of the utmost importance to us. The day you book your order the items are considered out of our inventory for your date and thus made unavailable to other potential customers.
              This ensures you will have all the items you need on the date you require them. Because of this, we do have certain policies regarding changes to your order.
            All reductions in numbers must be received by Marvin's Party Rental 14 days prior to your event. Any reductions or cancellations made within 14 days will be subject to a cancellation fee.
            Any increases in your numbers must be made prior to your pick-up or delivery, and are subject to item availability. These items will be billed separately. You may make changes by phone, email,
            or in person. This policy helps us to ensure that your order is packed as accurately as possible. See our Cancellation Policy below for more detailed information.</p>
            <h5>CANCELLATION POLICY</h5>
            <p>Reductions in quantity are limited to 20% of the original amount ordered per item and must be made a minimum of 14 days prior to your event to avoid penalty. Reductions in quantity greater
             than 20% and/or any reductions made within 14 days of your event are subject to a penalty of 50% of the total rental rate of the cancelled item(s) plus taxes. Any items cancelled within 1 week
             of the event will be charged at full rental rates plus taxes.</p>
            <h5>PICKING-UP YOUR RENTAL (revising)</h5>
            <p>Unless special arrangements have been made prior to your pick-up, you may pick-up your rental any time after 12:00pm on the day before your event, and may return no later than 12:00pm on the day
              specified on your rental contract. Either you or someone else can pick up your order. If another person will be picking up they will need to know what name your order is booked under and settle any
              remaining balance owing on the account. If you require your rental earlier than 12:00pm on the day before your event, you may contact Marvin's Party Rental to see if it will be ready earlier.
              You are responsible for any and all damage that may occur during transportation to and from your event site.</p>
            <h5>DELIVERY & PICK UP</h5>
            <p>Delivery rates are based on drop off to a point immediately accessible to our truck, usually your driveway, garage, or yard. All deliveries require the signature of a responsible party for equipment to be left.
               Should you require delivery beyond our truck tailgate or set-up and take down of items, please request a quote prior to your event.
            Delivery times are set on the week of delivery. You will be given a morning or afternoon delivery time. Morning delivery means the items will be delivered between 8am and 12pm.
             Afternoon delivery means between 12pm and the last delivery of the day. Our trucks will deliver until their schedule is complete. Should you have special delivery requests,
              please contact us and we will do our best to accommodate your needs. As there are many deliveries in a day it is not always possible to give exact delivery times. For an additional fee it is possible to arrange for before-
              and after-hours deliveries, as well as time specific deliveries.</p>
            <h5>SET-UP</h5>
            <p>We will set up all Festival, Marquee and Clearspan tents, all tent specific accessories, dance floors, portable flooring, staging, and custom lighting packages. We are available to set up chairs,
              tables, general lighting and other items for an additional set-up and tear-down fee. We do not generally offer set up of table settings, linens, or other general decor items but we can often coordinate
               this if required. Delivery is an additional fee as rates will vary on location.</p>
            <h5>OUT OF TOWN EVENTS</h5>
            <p>We do rent for out-of-town events. You can pick the items up yourself or we can deliver. Should you require delivery please contact us for a delivery rate. We can also help you arrange shipment of some rentals
              via courier. Multi day rates may apply if items will need to be shipped via courier, picked-up by yourself, or delivered more than 24 hours in advance of your event. You are responsible for any and all damage
              that may occur during transportation to and from your event site by a third party.</p>
            <h5>PLEASE CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOUR ORDER IS COMPLETE</h5>
            <p>We do our best to make sure your order is complete. If you discover any missing or damaged items upon receipt, please contact us immediately so that we can make a note on your account and make arrangements to
              replace the items if desired. If it is after store hours please leave a message or call our after-hours emergency line. We will contact you as soon as possible. Many factors can contribute to items being lost or
              damaged during an event. We cannot accept disputes after an event is over.</p>
            <h5>RETURNS</h5>
            <p>If you will not be returning the items yourself or present for the pick-up, or will not be in contact after your event, Marvin's Party Rental will require the name and contact information of the person who will be responsible
              for your rental. It is best to appoint one trustworthy person to be in charge of the return.
            On return, linens must be dry to prevent mildew, free of any wax, food or confetti and placed in the nylon bags provided. Do not place damp linens in plastic bags.
            We ask that you scrape or rinse the plates and cutlery free of any food, empty the glasses, and rinse food service items. All items should be placed back into the containers
            they arrived in. Avoid leaving excess water in the bottom of any containers as any metal pieces may rust.
            **We often receive back items that do not belong to us. Any items found with your order will be collected, rinsed, and packaged. You will be informed as soon as possible after
            your event if there is anything here to pick-up. We will store the items for no longer than 30 days. If we have not heard from you after 30 days, the items will be discarded or donated to a local charity.**
            IF YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE IS RETURNING YOUR RENTAL
            To avoid extra charges, we recommend that you count your order before returning it to ensure all items and packaging are accounted for. Marvin's Party Rental also counts every order when it is
            returned to our warehouse. If you are not willing or able to wait for your order to be counted by Marvin's Party Rental staff upon return, then we will not accept any disputes over missing or
            damaged items. As we take in many orders in a day, there may be a slight wait as returns are counted on a first come, first serve basis.
            IF Marvin's Party Rental IS PICKING-UP YOUR RENTALS
            Rental items need to be returned to their point of delivery. China, glassware and flatware should be “dishwasher ready” and placed back in their supplied containers.
            All original containers and boxes must be returned. Tables and chairs should be folded and stacked neatly. Linens should be placed in nylon bags provided. If your order is
            not ready for pick-up when Marvin's Party Rental arrives, we will return at our discretion for an additional one-way pick-up charge.</p>
