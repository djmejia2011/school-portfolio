					Best Places to Take Portraits in the DMV
				</h4>
				<h6>By David Mejia Published: 12/10/2019</h6>
				
				<p>			
				The DC, Maryland and Virginia metropolitan area has many places that are beautiful as backgrounds in a portrait.  The following article will display some
				of those wonderful places in the DMV.
				</p>
				<h5>The US Capitol</h5>

				<Strong>Address: </Strong> First St SE,<br>Washington, DC 20004<br>
				<br>				
				The US Capitol has many opportunities for a nice architectural background. Best suited for senior or graduation portraits, 
				the marble finish creates a nice neutral background that helps when trying to make the subject stand up in the composition.<br>
				<strong>Cons: </strong>Tripods/Monopods are not permitted in some areas.  It tends to get crowded during the summer. Parking is a nightmare.<br>
				<strong>Pros: </strong>Neutral background. Great for large groups.

				<p>			
				Have you ever wondered what to look for when choosing a photographer for your next event or family portrait?
				The following article helps you make better questions to potential photographers so that you don't end up with disappointing photographs.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Ask a photographer for their portfolio. If a photographer can not display their work it means that they are hiding something bad.</li>
				
				<li>Ask the photographer if they use a DSLR or a point-and-shoot camera.   
				I have seen people that call themselves photographers using cheap consumer-grade cameras to shoot an entire wedding and believe me the results are awful.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>To be continue...</p>
